* Another minor release with a couple of bug fixes to handle how categories and alarms
are handled. We've also added better handling for command line parsing and added pycairo
as a new dependency, removing the previous dependency to python-image. This will allow
us to add some really nice reporting utilities and general user interface improvements
in a future release. Finally, we've added several new translations!

For detailed information about what's new and what has been fixed, take a look at the ChangeLog.
