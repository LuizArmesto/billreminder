BillReminder 0.3.x
==================

Frontend:
  * A new calendar widget has been added to replace the caledar from the
  add/edit dialog. In order to display the calendar, it is necessary to
  expand the widget by clicking on the displayed date.
  * Repeating bills are now handled by selecting a frequency (the current
  allowed values are: once, weekly, and monthly) and setting the end date.
  Multiple records will then be added using the start and end date to figure
  out their correct due date.
  * A new timeline widget has been added to replace the calendar from the main
  window. You can now use it to change the way you view your bills by
  selecting an specific date with a single click as well as drag the
  timeline to view past and/or future bills. The following keyboard
  shortcuts are available:

  With focus:
    right arrow     go to next day
    left arrow      go to previous day
    Ctrl + right    go to same day next month
    Ctrl + left     go to same day previous month
    + (plus)        zoom in
    - (minus)       zoom out
    HOME            go to today's date
    PAGEUP          scroll to next screen*
    PAGEDOWN        scroll to previous screen

  * go to current day plus the number of days displayed in widget.

Backend:
  * Fixed an issue where datadir was hard coded to '/usr/share'. (Bug #553890).

  fixes Bug #553694.

BillReminder 0.3.0
==================

2008-03-01  Og Maciel <ogmaciel@gnome.org>

    * This was a massive rewrite of the entire application, and instead
    of listing all files that have been changd, I'll try to highlight
    the most important changes and features instead.
    * GLADE: BillReminder 0.3 was entirely re-written in order to remove
    all glade files and dependencies. The initial idea was to simply
    get rid of the dependency, but it also served as a learning process
    for me (and I believe the other contributors will agree with this
    as well).
    * DBUS: The DBUS layer received a bit more love from Luiz Armesto,
    breaking it down into the proper calls so to separate the 'engine'
    per se from the client.
    * UI: The user interface has also gone a series of changes and
    (hopefully) improvements. It is probably not 100% HIG compliant yet,
    but we'll gladly accept suggestions.
    * Bug management: Towards the last 8 weeks of development we've adopted
    the habit of filing bug reports prior to fixing the issues that we
    encountered during the development cycle.
    * Translations: All prior contributors promptly replied to my email
    asking them to update their translations:
