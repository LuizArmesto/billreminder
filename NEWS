* Another minor release with a couple of bug fixes to handle how categories and alarms
are handled. We've also added better handle for command line parsing and added pycairo
as a new dependency, removing the previous dependency to python-image. This will allow
us to add some really nice reporting utilities and general user interface improvements
in a future release. Finally, we've added 3 new translations: Croatian, Czech and 
Italian!
